  <h1>E-Commerce Web App Proposal</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the proposal for the E-Commerce Web App, designed to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience. This web app aims to incorporate the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User Authentication and Registration System:</li>
    <p>Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This ensures a personalized shopping experience.</p>
    <li>Interactive Product Catalog:</li>
    <p>The product catalog will showcase products with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and pricing information. Users can explore products based on categories and apply filters to find their desired items.</p>
    <li>Responsive Shopping Cart:</li>
    <p>The shopping cart will dynamically update as users add or remove products. Real-time price calculations will be displayed to provide transparency.</p>
    <li>Secure Checkout and Payment Integration:</li>
    <p>Our web app will integrate Stripe to handle secure payment processing. Users can confidently complete their transactions, knowing that their financial information is protected.</p>
    <li>Order History Tracking and Updates:</li>
    <p>Customers will have access to their order history, including order details and status updates. This feature enhances transparency and keeps users informed about their purchases.</p>
    <li>Efficient Admin Panel:</li>
    <p>An admin panel will provide administrators with the tools to manage products, categories, and orders. This ensures smooth backend operations.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>The website will be built using modern technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Stripe for payment processing.</p>
